    <p>
        For this project, I implemented a version of the arcade game Space Invaders in Verilog using a
        <a href="https://digilent.com/reference/_media/nexys:nexys3:nexys3_rm.pdf" target="_blank"
           rel="noreferrer">Nexys3 Spartan 6 FPGA board</a>. The game consists of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A player, which can be moved left and right across the bottom of the screen</li>
        <li>A laser, which can be shot upwards from the player's laser base</li>
        <li>A 5x11 grid of invaders that continuously moves left and right across the middle of the screen</li>
        <li>3 missiles, which the invaders somewhat randomly shoot down towards the player</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="has-text-centered">
        <img src="/images/space-invaders/game_initial.jpg" alt="Initial game state" width="500" height="auto" />
        <p>Initial game state</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The gameplay is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The player starts with 3 lives. Each time the player is hit by a missile, one life is lost. The player
        loses when no more lives remain.</li>
        <li>The player's score is increased by one each time an invader is shot down. The player wins the game when
        no more invaders remain.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="has-text-centered">
        <img src="/images/space-invaders/game_mid.jpg" alt="Game during play" width="500" height="auto" />
        <p>Game during play</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        And the game is implemented as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Left and right buttons for player movement</li>
        <li>Shoot button for the player's laser</li>
        <li>Reset button that returns the game to its initial state at any point</li>
        <li>3 seven-segment displays for the player's lives and score count</li>
        <li>VGA output to display the game on an external monitor</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="has-text-grey-light">VGA Implementation</h4>
    <p>
        The VGA display has a resolution of 640x480 pixels and is driven by a 25 MHz pixel clock, giving it
        a refresh rate of approximately 60 Hz. It supports 8-bit color. Much of the display code is based on
        <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/hardware-sprites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this tutorial</a>.
        My implementation for the following modules can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/tiffany1618/space-invaders/tree/main/src/vga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h6 class="has-text-grey-light">VGA Timings Module</h6>
    <p>
        Below is a diagram of the display timings and corresponding screen coordinates. We are using
        signed coordinates here so that the blanking interval can occur before the active drawing area, but
        the first pixel of the active drawing area will still be (0,0) so we donâ€™t need to worry about offsetting
        all of our other coordinates. We want the blanking interval to occur before the active drawing area
        so that any setup for drawing sprites at the edge of the screen, which needs to occur before the first
        sprite pixel is drawn, can still occur during the same frame as the frame the sprite is actually drawn
        in.
    </p>

        <p>VGA signal timings</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        This module outputs the horizontal and vertical sync signals, as well as a frame signal that indicates
        the start of the blanking interval, when we can animate our sprites and check our collision signals. It also
        outputs a data enable signal that is high during the active drawing period, and the current horizontal
        and vertical screen coordinates.
    </p>
    <h6 class="has-text-grey-light">Draw Sprite Module</h6>
    <p>
        This module draws a single sprite from a bitmap that can be scaled vertically and horizontally by the
        same constant. The sprite is represented as a 2d array, which can be loaded from a bitmap.
        Horizontal and vertical variables are maintained for addresses of the sprite pixel currently being drawn,
        and the output drawing signal is set to high if the sprite is currently being drawn (state = DRAW) and the
        bit at the current address is high. This is implemented as a finite-state machine, which can be seen below.
    </p>

        <p>State diagram for sprite drawing</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Signals:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>start: Signals when to start the sprite drawing</li>
        <li>pixel_x: Current horizontal screen coordinate</li>
        <li>spr_x: Top left x coordinate of the sprite</li>
        <li>x: Horizontal address within sprite bitmap</li>
        <li>y: Vertical address within sprite bitmap</li>
    </ul>
    <h6 class="has-text-grey-light">Draw Sprite Row Module</h6>
    <p>
        This module draws a row of 11 sprites from a single bitmap that can be scaled vertically and horizontally by the
        same constant, and allows for individual sprites in the row to be visible or hidden. Its logic is very similar
        to the previous modules, with the addition of a START_SPRITE state between AWAIT_POS and DRAW, which increments
        a counter indicating the position of the sprite currently being drawn, and checks to see if the next sprite
        should be drawn or hidden.
    </p>
    <h6 class="has-text-grey-light">VGA Controller Module</h6>
    <p>
        This module receives the positions of everything that needs to be drawn on the screen and handles
        drawing them or starting the correct drawing modules, outputting the correct 8-bit color pixel. This
        includes blinking the player when it has been hit by a missile. It also detects collisions between the
        player and the missiles or the invaders and the laser by using the drawing signals (if two objects are
        being drawn at the same time, then they have collided).
    </p>
    <h4 class="has-text-grey-light">Button Debouncing</h4>
    <p>
        Physical switches and buttons can cause small vibrations when they are pressed or flipped, resulting in small
        voltage fluctuations that can appear as multiple button presses within a very short amount of time,
        rather than as a single press. To solve this issue, we can sample the button state at a slower frequency,
        and only report the button as being pressed when it can maintain the same state for some period of
        time longer than the period of an average voltage fluctuation.
    </p>
    <p>
        To implement button debouncing, I used a 100 Hz clock to sample the button signals.
        These samples were accumulated in a 3-bit register for each button, so that each clock cycle, a new sample
        was added to the left-hand side of the register and the other bits were shifted right by one bit, discarding the least
        significant bit. The 2 rightmost bits represented
        a change in button state (0 then 1 means the button went from off to on, 1 then 0
        means the button went from on to off). The third bit was the debouncing bit - since the sampling frequency was
        100 Hz, the signal was required to stay high or low for at least 10 ms before
        we could conclude that the button was actually on or off, and that the high/low signal was
        not just the result of a fluctuation.

        Above, clk_debouncer is a 100 Hz clock, btn_right is the signal from the button we are debouncing, step_right
        is the 3-bit sampling register, and right is the debounced button signal.
        Code for this debouncing logic can be found
