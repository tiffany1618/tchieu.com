        I wrote this basic image processing library mainly for the purpose of learning about image processing
        techniques and learning the Rust programming language. It provides a flexible container for storing and
        manipulating different image formats and channel data types, and supports color space conversions, tone
        adjustments, linear filtering through convolution, and basic affine transformations. Check out the links above
        to learn more!
