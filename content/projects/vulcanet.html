        The goal of this project is to provide a reliable, low-cost early detection system for
        wildfires. VulcaNet is an extensible IoT mesh network that aggregates environmental
        sensor data from various locations within a given area, such as ambient temperature,
        humidity, barometric pressure, and carbon dioxide air content. Based on these parameters,
        the system can predict the likeliness and detect the presence of wildfires in the area.
