            Hi there! My name is Tiffany Chieu. I'm a student at UCLA majoring in Computer Science and
            Engineering. My interests include computer vision and image processing, embedded systems, and CubeSat software
            development. When I'm not programming, you can find me hiking, reading, or playing the piano.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm interning at JPL on the Small Scale Flight Software group, where I'm working on
            <a href="https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FPP</a>, a modeling
            language for the <a href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">F'</a> flight
            software framework.
            I am also co-leading the Command and Data Handling team on Project Rapid at UCLA's
            <a href="https://bruinspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bruin Spacecraft Group</a>. We are
            working on developing CubeSat flight software in C++ and designing a custom PCB for peripheral sensors.
        </p>
