            Hi there! My name is Tiffany Chieu. I'm a student at UCLA majoring in Computer Science and
            Engineering. My interests include computer vision and image processing, embedded systems, and CubeSat software
            development. When I'm not programming, you can find me hiking, reading, or playing the piano.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm the software lead on Project Reach at UCLA's
            <a href="https://bruinspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bruin Spacecraft Group</a>. Our goal is to
            develop amateur rocket payloads using the CubeSat form factor while introducing students to the field of satellite
            and aerospace engineering. We are in the process of developing the
            <a href="https://github.com/Bruin-Spacecraft-Group/SPARTAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SPARTAN Flight
                Software</a> to serve as a modular platform for CubeSat flight systems. SPARTAN provides a sensor driver
            library built with Intel's
            <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/mraa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eclipse Mraa Library</a>, in
            addition to an extensible data packet framework to streamline sensor data collection.
        </p>
