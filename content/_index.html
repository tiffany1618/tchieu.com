            Hi there! My name is Tiffany Chieu. I'm a student at UCLA majoring in Computer Science and
            Engineering. My interests include computer vision and image processing, embedded systems, and CubeSat software
            development. When I'm not programming, you can find me hiking, reading, or playing the piano.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm a member of the software team on Project Rapid at UCLA's
            <a href="https://bruinspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bruin Spacecraft Group</a>. We are
            working on developing flight software for the UCLA Research Satellite (URSa) using
            <a href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">F'</a>, a flight software
            framework developed at JPL.
        </p>
