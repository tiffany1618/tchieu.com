            Hi there! My name is Tiffany Chieu. 
            My interests include programming languages and compilers, computer vision and image processing, 
            and embedded systems. When I'm not programming, you can find me hiking, reading, or playing the piano.

            Currently, I'm a software engineer at Apple on Audio and Media
            Technologies, where I'm developing audio and video conferencing
            applications, including FaceTime.
            Previously, I interned at JPL on the Small Scale Flight Software
            group, developing compiler tools for the
            <a href="https://github.com/fprime-community/fpp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FPP</a>
            modeling language and integrating it into a suite of automatic code generation tools provided by the
            <a href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">F'</a> flight
            software framework.
