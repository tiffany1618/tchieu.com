            Hi there! My name is Tiffany Chieu. I'm a student at UCLA majoring in Computer Science and
            Engineering. My interests include computer vision and image processing, embedded systems, and CubeSat software
            development. When I'm not programming, you can find me hiking, reading, or playing the piano.
        </p>

            Currently, I lead the Command and Data Handling team on Project Rapid at UCLA's
            <a href="https://bruinspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bruin Spacecraft Group</a>. We are
            working on developing CubeSat flight software in C++.
