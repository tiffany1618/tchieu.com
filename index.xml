      <description> crates.io Full documentation   I wrote this basic image processing library mainly for the purpose of learning about image processing techniques and learning the Rust programming language. It provides a flexible container for storing and manipulating different image formats and channel data types, and supports color space conversions, tone adjustments, linear filtering through convolution, and basic affine transformations. Check out the links above to learn more! </description>

      <description>ECE 3 Final Project   The goal of this project was to develop a path-following car based on the TI-RSLK car platform using a series of IR sensors and a PID controller. Code for the path-following system can be found here, and code for the basic Arduino PID controller that was used can be found here. The path-following system began with an auto-calibration routine in which the car was placed over a white area, followed by a black area, from which minimum and maximum values were calibrated for each sensor.</description>

      <description>Created by: Tiffany Chieu, Nashir Janmohamed, Justin Lin, and Ariel Young Awards: Best IoT that Incorporates Multiple Nodes, San Diego Hackathon 2019   The goal of this project is to provide a reliable, low-cost early detection system for wildfires. VulcaNet is an extensible IoT mesh network that aggregates environmental sensor data from various locations within a given area, such as ambient temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and carbon dioxide air content.</description>
