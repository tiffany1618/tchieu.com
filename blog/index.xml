      <description>Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) intrinsics allow us to vectorize operations that would otherwise occur sequentially. This can greatly speed up a series of simple, repetitive operations that might be normally executed using loops. One place such operations are commonly found is in image processing.
For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to write a function that increases the brightness of an image. We can do that by simply adding a value to each channel in the image.</description>
