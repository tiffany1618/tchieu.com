      <description>Repository  Crates.io  Documentation       I wrote this basic image processing library mainly for the purpose of learning about image processing techniques and learning the Rust programming language. It provides a flexible container for storing and manipulating different image formats and channel data types, and supports the following types of image operations:  Color space conversions between sRGB, HSV, CIE XYZ, and CIELAB Brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments Gamma correction and histogram equalization Linear filtering through convolution Nonlinear filters such as the median, bilateral, and alpha-trimmed mean filters Basic affine transformations Morphological operations   In addition, this library supports multithreading for some transformation functions and most filter functions via rayon.</description>

      <title>TI-RSLK Path Follower</title>

      <description>The goal of this project was to develop a path-following car based on the TI-RSLK car platform using a series of IR sensors and a PID controller. Code for the path-following system can be found here, and code for the basic Arduino PID controller that was used can be found here.  The path-following system began with an auto-calibration routine in which the car was placed over a white area, followed by a black area, from which minimum and maximum values were calibrated for each sensor.</description>

Awards: Best IoT that Incorporates Multiple Nodes, San Diego Hackathon 2019
Repository  Devpost       The goal of this project is to provide a reliable, low-cost early detection system for wildfires. VulcaNet is an extensible IoT mesh network that aggregates environmental sensor data from various locations within a given area, such as ambient temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and carbon dioxide air content.</description>
